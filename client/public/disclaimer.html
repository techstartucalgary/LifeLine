        Lifeline assumes no responsibility for losses/damages of any nature whatsoever as a result of the use of our
        service. Lifeline has made every attempt to ensure the accuracy and reliability of our product. However, we

        Errors in the processing interpretation have the chance of occurring due to the nature of the current
        limitations in the logic.
    </p>
    <p>
        Accuracy of interpretation is also dependent on the structure of the file provided. Our product is the most
        accurate when the document makes use of tables, however, accuracy may vary if deadlines are written differently.
    </p>
    <p>
        We strongly recommend the manual verification of all data retrieved from the files being read. Our goal is to
        speed up and simplify the process of inputting deadlines, however we cannot guarantee the full accuracy of every
        type of reminder generated.
