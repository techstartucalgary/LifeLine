### Contributing to the backend

- Before you start making contributions to the backend, make sure you have the virtual environment set up and have all the packages installed from requirements.txt (Steps given up)
- After this you're good to make changes and install the required packages (Remember to do all of this with your virtual environment activated)
- Once you're done making the changes, cd into the `server` folder and  add all the new pip packages that you've installed to `requirements.txt`. You can do this by running the command `python -m pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- After this you're good to commit the changes (along with the changes to the `requirements.txt` file) and open up a Pull Request.
