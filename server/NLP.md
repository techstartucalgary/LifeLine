## notes

- find out what time frame the course exists in
  - if dates are outside of the range, don't count them
  - need to know what the range is. from pdf, from school calendar.
    - e.g. map (Winter 2023) -> [Jan 9 2023 - April 26 2023]
- get tables
  - read from tables. Algorithm for interpreting tables (Dataframes)
- get text
  - read from text. Can we exclude content from tables? Simple pattern matching should suffice - might be more involved since it might not be contiguous
  - get dates from text. For each date, find the subject of the sentence it belongs to. e.g. the subject of the sentence containing December 3 is "Portfolio presentation"
- some measure of certainty (0-1) for each date
- get name of course.
  - simple pattern match with first page / PDF name
  - ask user to manually fill it in. not a big ask
